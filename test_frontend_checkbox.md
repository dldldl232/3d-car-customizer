# Frontend Checkbox Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The "Enable Manual Mode" checkbox was not clickable due to Canvas/Three.js interfering with DOM events.

## Changes Made
1. **Wrapped ManualCorrectionControls in positioned div** with `z-50 pointer-events-auto`
2. **Removed conflicting absolute positioning** from ManualCorrectionControls
3. **Added debugging logs** to track click events

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd car-customization-app
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser Console
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Go to Console tab

### 3. Test the Checkbox
1. Select a car model and parts
2. Look for the "Manual Correction" panel in top-right corner
3. Click the "Enable Manual Mode" checkbox
4. Check console for these messages:
   ```
   handleManualModeToggle called! Current manualMode: false
   Manual mode will be set to: true
   ```

### 4. Verify Manual Mode Works
- When checkbox is checked, you should see:
  - "Drag the transform controls to adjust part position" message
  - "Save Adjustments" and "Reset to Auto" buttons
  - Transform controls on selected parts (if any)

### 5. Test Transform Controls
- If you have parts selected, you should see transform handles
- Drag the handles to adjust part position
- Click "Save Adjustments" to test save functionality

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Checkbox should be clickable
- ✅ Manual mode should toggle on/off
- ✅ Transform controls should appear when manual mode is enabled
- ✅ Save/Reset buttons should work
- ✅ Console should show debug messages

## If Still Not Working
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the ManualCorrectionControls is visible
3. Try clicking the label text instead of the checkbox
4. Check if any CSS is overriding the pointer-events

## Files Modified
- `car-customization-app/components/CarViewer.tsx`
  - Updated ManualCorrectionControls positioning
  - Added debugging to handleManualModeToggle
  - Wrapped controls in z-indexed div
