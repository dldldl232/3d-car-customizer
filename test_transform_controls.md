# Transform Controls Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
Parts couldn't be moved/adjusted when manual mode was enabled because:
1. Only `EnhancedPart` component had `TransformControls`
2. Parts were being rendered by other components without transform controls
3. `EnhancedPart` required GLB files and anchors

## Changes Made
1. **Force EnhancedPart for Manual Mode** - When manual mode is enabled, all parts use `EnhancedPart` regardless of GLB/anchors
2. **Enhanced EnhancedPart** - Now handles both GLB files and placeholder geometry
3. **Fallback Geometry** - Creates appropriate placeholder meshes when no GLB is available
4. **Transform Controls** - All parts now get transform controls when manual mode is enabled

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd car-customization-app
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser Console
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Go to Console tab

### 3. Test Transform Controls
1. Select a car model and parts
2. Enable manual mode (check the checkbox)
3. Look for these console messages:
   ```
   Manual mode enabled - using EnhancedPart for: [Part Name]
   ```

### 4. Verify Transform Controls Appear
- When manual mode is enabled, you should see:
  - Transform handles (arrows) on each selected part
  - Parts can be dragged to move them
  - Console shows transform changes

### 5. Test Part Movement
- Click and drag the transform handles (arrows)
- Parts should move in 3D space
- Console should show transform updates:
  ```
   handleManualTransformChange called for part [ID]
   ```

### 6. Test Save Functionality
- Move some parts around
- Click "Save Adjustments"
- Check console for save messages

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ All parts get transform controls when manual mode is enabled
- ✅ Parts can be moved by dragging transform handles
- ✅ Transform changes are logged to console
- ✅ Save/Reset buttons work
- ✅ Parts work with or without GLB files

## Debugging
If transform controls don't appear:
1. Check console for "Manual mode enabled" messages
2. Verify parts are being rendered by `EnhancedPart`
3. Check if `TransformControls` components are being created
4. Look for any Three.js errors in console

## Files Modified
- `car-customization-app/components/CarViewer.tsx`
  - Updated part rendering logic to force `EnhancedPart` in manual mode
  - Enhanced `EnhancedPart` to handle placeholder geometry
  - Added fallback geometry creation
  - Improved transform control integration
